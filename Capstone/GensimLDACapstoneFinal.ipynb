focal point whenever veered much telling hulme story pauline screen pace started flag something look first assembly trim cut hulme scenes fundamentally interesting rieper scenes although film different braindead take place new zealand familiar country watching two films would assume least period fairly repressive kind society acting almost breeding ground transgression explosive kinds behavior pj well script braindead set modern day last minute worried going movie hero film named lionel acted fairly nerdy kind way socialize takes care mother yet wanted empathetic character film afraid set modern day audience especially young audience would really jeer character able relate set inthe people might actually feel sympathy would think well sort thing happened heavenly creatures really coincidence actual event taken place fw repression still much evidence expressive demonstrative scared showing saying much go new york instance people yelling horns blaring happened someone would get theircar rip open door bash level violence subtext violence running new zealand society comes movies veneer easygoing underneath full rage interesting social dynamic makes interesting art pleasant actually live much link england pj christchurch particular fw christchurch suffers city new zealand always described little piece england considered english england always aspired still ways pj thing murder sense talk older generation christchurch embarrassment city somehow shameful somehow humiliating ridiculous story ultimately family tragedy fw said christchurch appalled revelation pauline parents married murder uncharitable souls even suggested one sinful act led speaking generally films seem certain love campiness apparent use caricatures many characters well overall sort extremism reminiscent work someone like john waters u interesting heavenly creatures remains fundamentally realistic docudrama figures authority like doctor vicar headmistress hilariously overplayed pj well like movies entertaining little larger life something like braindead obviously problem heavenly creatures telling hoped would fairly accurate story time however still wanted make movie want something totally tied real life totally dull little bit fun characters guess trying justify could say presenting girls point view strictly true think really two people needed realistic juliet pauline slightly larger life anyway something came across interviews classmates remembered sort terrifying juliet confident loud pauline brooding dark sense film perfect one us like stuff totally naturalistic
